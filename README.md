Telelgram Bot on aiogram on python 3.8.2
How to start working with a bot:
### `git clone https://github.com/Toktorov/telegram_bot_aiogram.git`
After you have cloned the git repository, run the file bot.py
### `python bot.py`
In the eleventh line where where is the admin variable, change the id to your own so that the admin panel works for you
### `@getmyid_bot`
If you donâ€™t know where to get your id, then I advise you to telegram bot @getmyid_bot
Thank you for your attention and good luck!
After the runserver everything should work, good luck!
